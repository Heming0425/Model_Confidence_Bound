### Model_Confidence_Bound
When choosing proper variable selection methods, it is important to consider the uncertainty of a certain method. The MCB for variable selection identifies two nested models (upper and lower confidence bound models) containing the true model at a given confidence level. A good variable selection method is the one of which the MCB under a certain confidence level has the shortest width. When visualizing the variability of model selection and comparing different model selection procedures, Model uncertainty curve is a good graphical tool. A good variable selection method is the one of whose MUC will tend to arch towards the upper left corner. This function aims to obtain the MCB and draw the MUC of certain single model selection method under a coverage rate equal or little higher than user-given confidential level.
